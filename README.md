### API for project management

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ErickWendel/testing-serverless-apps/workflows/Docker%20Actions/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ErickWendel/testing-serverless-apps/actions)

### project description

This is in principle a very challenging project as it involves many tables and many relationships,
developed from the beginning, starting with data modeling, then it was time to choose the technologies,
I chose to develop with nestjs because it is robust and because I wanted to learn more about it, I used Postgres as the database.

### technologies used

- **Nest js** - Framework based on node js.
- **typescript** - By default, nest already comes with typescript.
- **Prisma** - ORM for relational databases.
- **Postgres** - Relational database.
- **Docker** â€“ Containers to upload the database
- **Husky** - For commit routine, for example. Before making a commit, run tests or format the code.
- **Prettier** - To format the code and follow a pattern throughout the project
- **dbdiagram** - I used this software to model the data.

### Relationships

This is a project where there are several relationships which is really cool, besides being challenging, you get a lot of learning
with relational databases.

You can see all the relationships in the schema.prisma file,
I also provided a diagram where all the tables and relationships are.


### conclusion

It's been a challenging project and good for my evolution as a developer, I'm facing several
challenges, solving them and acquiring a lot of knowledge.
